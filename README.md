This is a complete full-stack project, designed with PHP for basic web layout, JavaScript for frontend features such as search filtering and dynamic course display, 
and MySQL database for backend operations such as user registration, course information updating, and deletion.

Database

The database is an indispensable part of this project. When users register, their validated information such as name, email, phone number, etc., will be updated to the database in real-time. After successful registration and login, users can select courses for reservation through the booking page, or cancel (delete) previously selected courses. 
Users can also update courses, all of which are achieved through PHP for real-time updating of records in the database.
